# Kael

`Kael` is a CMS which core functionality is written in
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and exposes a [Lua](http://www.lua.org) API
that allows users to write themes in Lua, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The main goals of the project are:

- Is fun to use
- Is stable
- Built using modern technology

## Testing

The project is tested in 3 different levels: unit, integration and acceptance. 

### Unit

These tests prove that pure functions produce the expected output. They should
be written using QuickCheck.

### Integration

These tests prove that different subsystems of the project works together as
expected. For example check that database functions produce the expected output
from a known state. They should be written using HSpec.

### Acceptance

These tests prove that the project works as expected from a users perspective.

The user perspective is considered the web interface by using a minimal browser
that does not support javascript, css, flash etc. The project is built with
progressive enhancement in mind to be able to serve all types of users.

They should be written using behave, cucumber and mechanize.

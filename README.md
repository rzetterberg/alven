# Alven

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rzetterberg/alven.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rzetterberg/alven)

**Version:** 0.1.0 (not suitable for production)

`Alven` is a CMS written in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) that embeds
[Lua](http://www.lua.org) for writing themes.

The project comes with an admin interface where the user can manage pages,
accounts and navigation menus. Pages are written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in the admin
interface.

Showing the page content to the visitor is then handled by the Lua theme.

The project exports a Lua module called `alven`, which can be used in the theme
to get resources from the CMS (such as page lists, page content,
internal URLs etc.)

Here's an example of a theme that uses [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) to
render a template to display the content of the current page: 

```lua
-- To add a 3rd party Lua library you just put the source files in the theme
-- directory and use require
local lustache = require "lustache"

data = {
    -- Retrieves a list of all the pages that exists in the CMS
    page = alven.get_current_page();
    -- Retrives the current page the user is visiting. The CMS handles the
    -- routing and database calls to retrieve the content.
    pages = alven.get_pages(),
    -- A mustache lambda that can be used to render absolute URLs to files in
    -- the theme, such as CSS-files and images.
    theme_url = function (render, text)
       return alven.get_theme_url(text)
    end
}

-- Reads the whole mustache file and returns it as a string
template = alven.read_theme_file("base.mustache")
output = lustache:render(template, data)

-- Appends the given string to the output buffer that becomes the HTTP response
-- body after the Lua theme has finished execution.
-- This function can be called multiple times to build up the response
-- sequencially.
alven.output(output)
```

And here's what the `mustache` template looks like:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{{ page.name }}</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="{{#theme_url}}img/logotype.png{{/theme_url}}" alt="Haskell logotype" />
    <ul>
      {{#pages}}
        <li>
          <a href="{{{url}}}">
            {{name}}
          </a>
        </li>
      {{/pages}}
    </ul>

    {{{ page.body }}}
  </body>
</html>
```

The theme directory has the following structure:

```bash
$ cd src/static/theme
$ tree
.
├── base.mustache
├── img
│   └── logotype.png
├── lustache
│   ├── context.lua
│   ├── renderer.lua
│   └── scanner.lua
├── lustache.lua
└── main.lua

2 directories, 7 files
```

With one page created in the CMS named "Index" and with the content:

```markdown
# Index 

This is the index page, and it does not contain anything interesting yet.
```

After the theme has ben run the result will be:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Index</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="http://ip-of-the-container:3000/static/theme/img/logotype.png" alt="Haskell logotype" />
    <ul>
      
        <li>
          <a href="http://ip-of-the-container:3000/page/view/index">
            Index
          </a>
        </li>
      
    </ul>

    <h1>Index</h1><p>This is the index page, and it does not contain anything interesting yet.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Quick technical overview

`Alven` is written to be compiled with `GHC 7.8.*` using the
[Stackage LTS](https://www.stackage.org/) version set.

It is based on the [Yesod Web Framework](http://www.yesodweb.com/).

It is written to be deployed on `GNU/Linux`.

Development and testing is performed inside docker containers to allow easy
and consistent setup. All images used in the project are based on the offical
[`haskell:7.8`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/haskell/) and 
[`debian:jessie`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/debian/) images.

There are 3 docker containers:

- The builder which is used to build the whole project
- The database which runs the postgres database for testing and development
- The tester which is used to run the external acceptance tests

Testing is performed in 3 levels: unit, integration and acceptance.

Unit and integration tests are written in `Haskell` and uses `hspec` for
structure.

Acceptance tests are written in `Python` and uses `cucumber` and `mechanize` to
test the admin interface from a minimal browser (no javascript, css, etc.)
point of view.

The embedded [Lua intepreter](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) is version `5.1.4`.

## Try out the project

To try out the project you first need to build the containers:

```bash
./build_docker.sh
```

(If you want to verify the docker setup, you can view the
dockerfiles in the `config/docker` directory for each image.)

Then you start the builder and database containers:

```bash
./start_builder.sh
```

This will start the database container in the background, start the builder
in the foreground and drop you into a shell inside it. Also, the project
folder will be mount as volume in the container. Which means you can make
changes to your project outside the container while it's running.

After that you simply start the development server:

```bash
cd src
yesod devel
```

(If you get an error saying the database is starting up, just re-run
`yesod devel`)

After the development server has started you can access the project in your
webbrowser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The development server is setup to use the builder containers' IP for URLs. So
the first link you click in the interface will redirect you to using the IP
instead of localhost.

To access the admin interface you goto `/admin`. Currently the project is setup
to allow user registration for anyone. When a registration is submitted the
verification link is printed to the console. Copy the link from the console and
open it in your browser to finish the registration.

By default the project does not come with a Lua theme, but you can use one of
the example themes used in the integration tests.

`Alven` tries to open the file `main.lua` in the folder `static/theme`. So, to
use the first example just run:

```bash
cp test/static/lua/examples/page_list static/theme -R
```

Now you can create pages in the admin interface and view them to see how the
theme renders the content.

You can make changes to the theme and just refresh the page in your browser
to see the changes.

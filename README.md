# Kael

`Kael` is a CMS which core functionality is written in
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and allows users to write theme layout and
functionality in [Lua](http://www.lua.org).

This project aims to use the best of both worlds to provide a CMS which is
fast, stable and easy to write themes for.

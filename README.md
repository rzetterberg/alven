# Kael

`Kael` is a CMS which core functionality is written in
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) and exposes a [Lua](http://www.lua.org) API
that allows users to define user interface and business logic in Lua, HTML,
Javacript and CSS.

The main goals of the project are:

- Performant
- Well documented
- Stable

## Features

The project functionality is described by Cucumber feature files in the folder
`features`. The features should be focused on describing user functionality, and
avoid describing internal functionality.
